## Future improvements

*We recognize that building a beautiful and convincing website is not a
simple or speedy task, which is why we'd like to see what future
improvements you would suggest to get this project to a 100% production
ready state. No suggestion is a bad one, and we welcome every detail you
provide.*

As this landing page was implemented with only Chrome for OS X in mind, it needs to be tested for cross browser compatibility. I would address undesirable browser differences and restyle or add browser-specific styles for features that aren't supported across most browsers. In addition, the site is only somewhat responsive, so several elements need to be revisited. This includes some images that don't scale properly as well as font, margin/padding, input and button sizes. The page is designed poorly for smaller devices, so breakpoints, media queries and min/max values should be added to deliver a mobile-friendly view. Lastly, I would perform an accessibility audit before shipping this landing page. Although I made intentional decisions in regards to this - such as writing descriptive `alt` labels and including images in the DOM instead of the background - I still have much to learn about accessibility and strongly believe that changes (unbeknown to me at this time) can be made to improve the experience for people with disabilities.
